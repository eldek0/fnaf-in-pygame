- Changed night 1. Now toy chica and toy freddy can move.
- Changed music box time.
- A barrel shader was added to the gameplay, similar to the original game.
- Now jumpscares don't stop until the sound ends.

TO FIX:
GENERAL
- Toy freddy takes way long to move
- Sometimes, sounds don't reproduce correctly

SHADER 
- Fade in gameplay does not work right (and when the night ends makes the game crash) FIXED
