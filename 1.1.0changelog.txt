- Minigames and more secrets were added
- A barrel shader was added to the gameplay, similar to the original game.
- Changed night 1. Now toy chica and toy freddy can move.
- Changed music box time.
- By pressing F11 you can exit fullscreen
- Now jumpscares don't stop until the sound ends.
- Game would sometimes crash while winding the music box
- Battery would still be consumed even if the camera is occupied
- Sounds would not reproduce correctly

TO FIX (preferently before adding the new stuff like minigames):
GENERAL
- Toy freddy takes way long to move
- Hallway animatronics often appear from nowhere
- Foxy leave hallway without waiting
- The game sometimes crashes at camera 11? FIXED
- The marionet (in the cutscene) is kinda glitched FIXED
- Encrypt private and public RSA is not the same as fnaf 1.0.05 FIXED

SHADER 
- Fade in gameplay does not work right (and when the night ends makes the game crash) FIXED

TO ADD
Minigames ! (SAVETHEM, Give Gifts, Give Life, Take Cake to the Children, Foxy Go! Go! Go!)
Easter eggs (shadow bonnie, shadow freddy, balloon girl, Paper Buddy, Endo skeletons, Eyeless Screens)
Be able to use the keyboard to play the game
Add helpful tips (like the ctrl tip to flashlight when you start the game)
