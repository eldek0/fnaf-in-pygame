- A barrel shader was added to the gameplay, similar to the original game.
- The game is now frame independent
- Changed night 1. Now toy chica and toy freddy can move.
- Changed music box time.
- Now jumpscares don't stop until the sound ends.

TO FIX:
GENERAL
- Toy freddy takes way long to move
- Sometimes, sounds don't reproduce correctly
- Weird bug with the game time (it seems that a . is provoking it)
- Hallway animatronics often appear from nowhere
- Foxy leave hallway without waiting
- The game sometimes crashes at camera 11?

SHADER 
- Fade in gameplay does not work right (and when the night ends makes the game crash) FIXED

TO ADD
Minigames ! (SAVETHEM, Give Gifts, Give Life, Take Cake to the Children, Foxy Go! Go! Go!)
Easter eggs (shadow bonnie, shadow freddy, balloon girl, Paper Buddy, Endo skeletons, Eyeless Screens)
